They often work with internal and external auditors to ensure that the organization passes compliance audits without issues.

4. **Vendor Risk Management**:
   - Many organizations work with third-party vendors, who may access sensitive data or interact with the organization's network. GRC professionals assess the cybersecurity practices of these vendors to ensure they donâ€™t introduce additional risks. Vendor risk management involves evaluating the security controls of third parties and ensuring that contracts include clauses that protect the organization from liabilities arising from a vendor's security breach.

5. **Incident Response Planning**:
   - While incident response is often handled by the Blue Team, the GRC team plays a critical role in developing and maintaining an incident response plan. This plan outlines the steps that the organization will take in the event of a cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach or malware attack. The GRC team ensures that the plan complies with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. They also ensure that all employees are aware of their roles and responsibilities during an incident.

6. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**:
   - GRC professionals ensure that cybersecurity measures align with the organization's business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) plans. These plans outline how the organization will continue to operate during and after a major incident, such as a cyberattack or natural disaster. GRC teams ensure that cybersecurity controls are in place to protect critical systems and data, allowing the business to recover quickly.
