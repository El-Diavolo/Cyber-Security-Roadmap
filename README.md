# 2. Foundational Knowledge

So now let us start on the foundational knowledge you need for cybersecurity. This section will cover essential concepts in IT and networking, key cybersecurity principles, Linux fundamentals, and basic programming skills, all of which are crucial for building a solid foundation for your cybersecurity career.

### Basics of IT and Networking
Understanding IT and networking is vital in cybersecurity. Here are the key topics you should focus on:

- **Networking Concepts**: Learn about how networks operate, including how devices communicate with one another. Familiarize yourself with concepts like **LAN** (Local Area Network), **WAN** (Wide Area Network), **VPN** (Virtual Private Network), and the different types of network topologies.

- **OSI Model**: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a framework that helps understand how data travels across networks. It consists of seven layers: 
  1. **Physical Layer**: Hardware transmission.
  2. **Data Link Layer**: Node-to-node data transfer.
  3. **Network Layer**: Routing and forwarding.
  4. **Transport Layer**: End-to-end communication.
  5. **Session Layer**: Managing sessions between applications.
  6. **Presentation Layer**: Data translation and encryption.
  7. **Application Layer**: End-user software interaction.

- **TCP/IP**: Understand the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model, which is the foundation of the internet. It includes protocols for various functions, like **IP addressing**, **subnetting**, and **routing**.

- **DNS**: Learn about the Domain Name System, which translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses. This is crucial for navigating the internet.

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Understand how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its secure version, HTTPS, work. Recognize the importance of HTTPS in securing data transmitted over the internet.

- **Resources**: To dive deeper, look for free online courses on platforms like Coursera, edX, or YouTube. Many tutorials and videos explain these concepts clearly, making it easier to grasp the fundamentals.

### Introduction to Cybersecurity Concepts
Once you have a grasp of IT and networking, itâ€™s time to explore key cybersecurity concepts:

- **CIA Triad**: Familiarize yourself with the CIA Triad, which represents the core principles of cybersecurity:
  - **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.
  - **Integrity**: Protecting data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals.
  - **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed.

- **Security Principles**: Understand fundamental security principles, such as least privilege (users should have only the access necessary to perform their job), defense in depth (implementing multiple layers of security), and security by design (integrating security into the development process).

- **Threat Models**: Learn about various threat models that describe potential risks and vulnerabilities in systems. Familiarize yourself with common threats like malware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, and insider threats.
